An initial large sample of 620 galaxies of disk galaxies from \citet{head_dissecting_2014} in the Coma Cluster was used as a basis for further refinement. Cluster membership was determined by a redshift of $~0.023$ with the centre of Coma taken as the mid-point between NGC4874 and NGC4889.

The \iband was selected in order to avoid the catastrophic OH-brightening and water absorption in the far-infrared and to enhance detection of `red and dead' S0s. Images were obtained from both SDSS and MegaCam for each galaxy in the sample. A point spread function (PSF) full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of between $0.65''$ and $0.84''$ was typical \citep{head_dissecting_2014}. The pixel scale was $~0.396$ arcsec pix$^{-1}$ for SDSS and $~0.186$ arcsec pix$^{-1}$ for MegaCam.
