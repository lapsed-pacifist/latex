	abstract = {We have estimated the bulge-to-total ({B/T)} light ratios in the Ks band for a sample of 24 S0, S0/a and Sa galaxies by applying a two-dimensional multicomponent decomposition method. For the disc an exponential function is used, the bulges are fitted by a S{\'e}rsic R1/n function and the bars and ovals are described either by a S{\'e}rsic or a Ferrers function. In order to avoid non-physical solutions, preliminary characterization of the structural components is made by inspecting the radial profiles of the orientation parameters and the low azimuthal wavenumber Fourier amplitudes and phases. In order to identify also the inner structures, unsharp masks were created: previously undetected inner spiral arms were found in {NGC} 1415 and marginally in {NGC} 3941. Most importantly, we found that S0s have a mean {?B/T?K} ratio of 0.24 {\textpm} 0.11, which is significantly smaller than the mean {?B/T?R=} 0.6 generally reported in the literature. Also, the surface brightness profiles of the bulges in S0s were found to be more exponential-like than generally assumed, the mean shape parameter of the bulge being ?n?= 2.1 {\textpm} 0.7. We did not find examples of barred S0s lacking the disc component, but we found some galaxies ({NGC} 718, 1452 and 4608) having a non-exponential disc in the bar region. To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to apply a multicomponent decomposition method for a moderately sized sample of early-type disc galaxies.},

We used the photometry of resolved stars to select distinct populations covering a wide range of stellar ages. We found breaks in the radial profiles of all stellar populations at 280'' ({\textasciitilde}5.1 kpc). Beyond this disk break, the profiles become steeper for younger populations. This same trend is seen in numerical simulations where the outer disk is formed almost entirely by radial migration. We also found that the older stars of {NGC} 7793 extend significantly farther than the underlying H I disk. They are thus unlikely to have formed entirely at their current radii, unless the gas disk was substantially larger in the past. These observations thus provide evidence for substantial stellar radial migration in late-type disks.},

	abstract = {We have obtained multifiber spectra of 125 early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster of galaxies, using the Hydra bench spectrograph on the 4m telescope at Kitt Peak. The sample selection was based on both color and morphology, care being taken to exclude intermediate and late-type spirals. Surprisingly, a large fraction (about 1/3) of all galaxies in a field located approximately 40 arcmin {SW} of the center of the cluster exhibits enhanced Balmer absorption lines or emission lines, indicative of recent star formation or nuclear activity. In contrast, very few such galaxies are found in the central field of the cluster. Those galaxies with abnormal spectra cover a range in luminosity down to B ? 19 ({MB} ? -15). Furthermore, the bulk of the abnormal spectrum galaxies are located near a secondary peak in the cluster X-ray emission found by Briel et.al. ({A\&A}, 259, L31,1992) and by Watt et.al. ({MNRAS}, 258, 738, 1992). We argue by detailed comparisons with Kennicutt's ({ApJS}, 79, 255, 1992) sequence of normal spiral galaxy spectra that the anomalous spectral features cannot arise from morphological misindentifications. Specifically, the abnormal spectra are fundamentally different, with [O {II]} emission lines too weak for the enhanced Balmer absorption. The spectra are, however, remarkably similar to the red H$\delta$-strong galaxies studied by Couch \& Sharples
({MNRAS}, 229, 423, 1987) in clusters at redshift z ? 0.3. Hence it appears that an environmental process similar to that frequently found in clusters at moderate redshift is occurring at the present epoch in the outskirts of the Coma cluster.},

	abstract = {We present azimuthally averaged radial profiles of R-band surface 
brightness for a complete sample of 47 early-type, unbarred galaxies, as
a complement to our previous study of early-type barred galaxies.
Following very careful sky subtraction, the profiles can typically be
determined down to brightness levels well below 27 mag
arcsec-2 and in the best cases below 28 mag
arcsec-2. We classified the profiles according to the scheme
used previously for the barred sample: Type I profiles are single
unbroken exponential radial declines in brightness; Type {II} profiles
("truncations") have an inner shallow slope (usually exponential) which
changes at a well-defined break radius to a steeper exponential; and
Type {III} profiles ("antitruncations") have an inner exponential that is
steeper, giving way to a shallower outer (usually exponential) decline.
By combining these profiles with previous studies, we can make the first
clear statements about the trends of outer-disk-profile types along the
Hubble sequence (including both barred and unbarred galaxies), and their
global frequencies. We find that Type I profiles are most frequent in
early-type disks, decreasing from one-third of all S0-Sa disks to barely
10\% of the latest-type spirals. Conversely, Type {II} profiles
(truncations) increase in frequency with Hubble type, from only {\textasciitilde}25\% of
S0 galaxies to {\textasciitilde}80\% of Sd-Sm spirals. Overall, the fractions of Type I,
{II}, and {III} profiles for all disk galaxies (Hubble types S0-Sm) are 21\%,
50\%, and 38\%, respectively; this includes galaxies ({\textasciitilde}8\% of the total)
with composite Type {II+III} profiles (counted twice). Finally, we note
the presence of bars in 10 galaxies previously classified (optically) as
"unbarred." This suggests that {\textasciitilde}20\% of optically unbarred galaxies are
actually barred; the bars in such cases can be weak, obscured by dust,
or so large as to be mistaken for the main disk of the galaxy.},

focused on the disk surface brightness profile outside the bar region,
with the aim of throwing light on the nature of Freeman type I and {II}
profiles, their origins, and their possible relation to disk
truncations. This paper discusses the data and their reduction, outlines
our classification system, and presents R-band profiles for all galaxies
in the sample, along with their classifications. In subsequent papers,
we will explore the structure of outer disks as revealed by these
profiles, and investigate their possible origins.

The profiles are derived from a variety of different sources, including
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Data Release 5). For about half of the
galaxies, we have profiles derived from more than one telescope; this
allows us to check the stability and repeatability of our profile
extraction and classification. The vast majority of the profiles are
reliable down to levels of $\mu$ R ? 27 mag
arcsec-2; in exceptional cases, we can trace profiles down to
$\mu$ R {\textgreater} 28. We can typically follow disk profiles out to
at least 1.5 times the traditional optical radius R 25; for
some galaxies, we find light extending to {\textasciitilde}3 {\texttimes} R 25.
For type I (single-exponential) profiles, this means that we can trace
the exponential disk out to 6-7 scale lengths.

We classify the profiles into three main groups: type I
(single-exponential), type {II} (down-bending), and type {III} (up-bending).
The frequencies of these types are approximately 27\%, 42\%, and 24\%,
respectively, plus another 6\% which are combinations of types {II} and
{III.} We further classify type {II} profiles by where the break falls in
relation to the bar length, and in terms of the postulated mechanisms
for breaks at large radii ("classical truncation" of star formation
versus the influence of the Outer Lindblad Resonance of the bar). We
also classify the type {III} profiles by the probable morphology of the
outer light (disk or spheroid). Illustrations are given for all cases.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed prescription for the modelling of galaxy formation in hierarchical theories of structure formation. Our model incorporates the formation and merging of dark matter haloes, the shock heating and radiative cooling of baryonic gas gravitationally confined in these haloes, star formation regulated by the energy released by evolving stars and supernovae, the merging of galaxies within dark matter haloes, and the spectral evolution of the stellar populations that are formed. The procedure that we describe is very flexible and can be applied to any hierarchical clustering theory. Our prescriptions for regulated star formation and galaxy mergers are motivated and constrained by numerical simulations. We are able to predict galaxy numbers, luminosities, colours and circular velocities. This investigation is restricted to the standard cold dark matter ({CDM)} cosmology, and we explore the effects of varying other assumptions, including the stellar initial mass function, star formation rates and galaxy merging. We compare the results of these models with an extensive range of observational data, including the B and K galaxy luminosity functions, galaxy colours, the Tully-Fisher relation, faint galaxy number counts, and the redshift distribution at B{\textasciitilde}22. This combination of observed galaxy properties strongly constrains the models and enables the relative importance of each of the physical processes included to be assessed. We present a broadly successful model defined by a plausible choice of parameters. This fiducial model produces a much more acceptable luminosity function than have most previous studies. This is achieved through a modest rate of galaxy mergers and strong suppression of star formation in haloes of low circular velocity by energy injected by supernovae and evolving stars. The model also accounts for the observed faint galaxy counts in both the B and K bands, and their redshift distributions. It fails, however, to produce galaxies as red as are many observed ellipticals and, compared with the observed Tully- Fisher relation, the model galaxies have circular velocities which are too large for their luminosities.},

We estimate the amount by which the {GC} specific frequency (number of {GCs} per unit V-band luminosity) is enhanced in S0s relative to spirals. If the transformation hypothesis is correct, and no {GCs} are created or destroyed in the process, then this difference provides a measure of the degree to which the S0's V-band luminosity has faded relative to that of its spiral progenitor. We also explore whether the degree to which the {GC} specific frequency is enhanced in S0s correlates with the colour of the stellar population, as also predicted by this hypothesis in which galaxies become redder as they fade. We find that, on average, the {GC} specific frequency is a factor {\textasciitilde}3 larger for S0s than for spirals, which can be interpreted as meaning that passively-evolving S0s have faded by about a factor of 3 from their spiral progenitors. This value fits remarkably well with the predictions of stellar population synthesis calculations, and the offset between the S0 and spiral Tully-Fisher relations. We also find that the global colours of S0 galaxies are strongly correlated with their {GC} specific frequencies: the redder the stellar population of an S0, the larger its specific frequency, as we might expect if we are catching different S0s at different stages of passively fading and reddening. Comparison to the predictions of stellar population synthesis models show that this explanation works quantitatively as well as qualitatively. These tests strongly support the hypothesis that S0 galaxies were once normal spirals, whose star formation was cut off, presumably due to a change of environment.},

not infinite exponential beyond galactocentric distances of about 3-5
radial scalelengths, the genuine structure of the truncation region is
not yet well known. Our data quantitatively establish a smooth
truncation behaviour of the radial surface brightness profiles and is
best described by a two-slope model, characterised by an inner and outer
exponential scalelength separated at a relatively well defined break
radius. This result disagrees with the frequently assumed sharply
truncated nature of the radial surface brightness profiles and implies
the presence of stars and even star-formation beyond the break radius.
In addition, we do not find a strong influence of a nearby companion on
the ratio of the break radius to the radial scalelength. Our results

To make this study, we have combined kinematic data, including a new high-quality spectral data set from the Fornax cluster, with homogeneous photometry from the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies and Two Micron All Sky Survey catalogues, to construct the largest sample of S0 galaxies ever used in a study of the {TFR.} Independent of environment, S0 galaxies are found to lie systematically below the {TFR} for nearby spirals in both optical and infrared bands. This offset can be crudely interpreted as arising from the luminosity evolution of spiral galaxies that have faded since ceasing star {formation.However}, we also find a large scatter in the {TFR.} We show that most of this scatter is intrinsic, not due to the observational uncertainties. The presence of such a large scatter means that the population of S0 galaxies cannot have formed exclusively by the above simple fading mechanism after all transforming at a single epoch. To better understand the complexity of the transformation mechanism, we have searched for correlations between the offset from the {TFR} and other properties of the galaxies such as their structural properties, central velocity dispersions and ages (as estimated from line indices). For the Fornax cluster data, the offset from the {TFR} correlates with the estimated age of the stars in the individual galaxies, in the sense and of the magnitude expected if S0 galaxies had passively faded since being converted from spirals. This correlation implies that a significant part of the scatter in the {TFR} arises from the different times at which galaxies began their transformation.},

Here we present the radial brightness profiles of a number of barred S0-Sb galaxies with the opposite behavior: their outer profiles are distinctly shallower in slope than the main disk profile. We term these antitruncations; they are found in at least 25\% of a larger sample of barred S0-Sb galaxies. There are two distinct types of antitruncations. About one-third show a fairly gradual transition and outer isophotes that are progressively rounder than the main disk isophotes, suggestive of a disk embedded within a more spheroidal outer zone{\textemdash}either the outer extent of the bulge or a separate stellar halo. But the majority of the profiles have rather sharp surface brightness transitions to the shallower, outer exponential profile and, crucially, outer isophotes that are not significantly rounder than the main disk; in the Sab-Sb galaxies, the outer isophotes include visible spiral arms. This suggests that the outer light is still part of the disk. A subset of these profiles are in galaxies with asymmetric outer isophotes (lopsided or one-armed spirals), suggesting that interactions may be responsible for at least some of the disklike antitruncations.},

	abstract = {There are two main theories for the formation of S0 galaxies: that S0 and elliptical galaxies are formed in the same manner ab initio, or that S0s are mainly spiral galaxies from which the gas has been stripped by interactions with either hot cluster gas or other galaxies. Perhaps the best way to test these formation ideas is to calculate the luminosities of S0 and spiral galaxies in the K band, where dust effects for the spiral galaxies are minimal. If S0s are stripped spirals whose star formation has been quenched, we expect from existing models that S0s should be {\textasciitilde}0.75 mag less luminous in K absolute magnitudes than early-type spirals. Using the nearly 25,000 galaxies in the Two Micron All Sky Survey that have total K magnitudes <=11.25, we are able to select over 19,000 of these galaxies for analysis. Of these, 10,977 are in the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies and 8230 are not. We separate galaxies by both Hubble type and whether they are in or out of nearby clusters and near or far from us. K-band absolute magnitudes are predicted using the velocity field model of Faber \& Burstein for galaxies with a velocity of 6000 km s-1 or less with respect to the cosmic background radiation. We present histograms, medians, and means for galaxies of all Hubble types in absolute K magnitudes. In all cases, we find that giant ellipticals are more luminous than S0s, and that S0s are at least as luminous, if not more luminous, in the K band than are spiral galaxies. The K absolute magnitudes of the S0s compared to those of the spirals show that S0s are not gas-stripped spiral galaxies. While a few S0s can be gas-stripped spirals, as a class they are not. We suggest that the {E+A} galaxies seen in clusters at moderate redshift are S0s onto which hot gas has cooled, producing a temporary sprinkling of star formation.},

For this purpose, we compare the bulge and disk luminosities of early- and late-type galaxies and of galaxies at different radial distances from the cluster center. We find that in order for early-type galaxies, including S0, to have evolved from late-type galaxies, their bulge luminosities must have been physically enhanced. Disk-fading models cannot explain the differences observed. We then show that galaxy bulges are systematically brighter at small projected distances from the cluster center, while disk luminosities are uncorrelated with clustercentric distance. Our results suggest that bulge enhancement, not disk fading, distinguishes early- from late-type galaxies and is thus at least partially responsible for the morphology-environment relation of bright cluster galaxies.},

The intrinsic colour scatter about the {CMR} is very small (0.076) in rest-frame U-V. Only 7\% of the galaxies are significantly bluer than the {CMR.} The scarcity of blue S0s indicates that, if they are the descendants of spirals, these were already red when they became S0s. We observe no dependence of the {CMR} scatter with redshift or cluster velocity dispersion. This implies that by the time cluster {E/S0s} achieve their morphology, the vast majority have already joined the red sequence. We estimate the galaxy formation redshift {z\_F} for each cluster and find that it does not depend on the cluster velocity dispersion. However, {z\_F} increases weakly with cluster redshift. This trend becomes clearer when including higher-z clusters from the literature, suggesting that, at any given z, in order to have a population of fully-formed E and S0s they needed to have formed most of their stars 2-4 Gyr prior to observation. In other words, the galaxies that already have early-type ({ET)} morphologies also have reasonably-old stellar populations. This is partly a manifestation of the "progenitor bias", but also a consequence of the fact that the vast majority of the {ETs} in clusters (in particular the massive ones) were already red by the time they achieved their morphology. E and S0 galaxies exhibit very similar colour scatter, implying similar stellar population ages. We also find that fainter {ETs} finished forming their stars later, consistent with the cluster red sequence being built over time and the brightest galaxies reaching the red sequence earlier than fainter ones. Finally, we find that the {ET} cluster galaxies must have had their star formation truncated over an extended period of at least 1 Gyr. [abridged]},

Our technique improves on previous {2D} fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the S{\'e}rsic,
Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the
potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the S{\'e}rsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains
intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an
interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

In both nearby and distant clusters, higher density regions contain proportionally fewer star-forming galaxies, and the average [O {II]} equivalent width of star-forming galaxies is independent of local density. However, in distant clusters the average current star formation rate ({SFR)} in star-forming galaxies seems to peak at densities {\textasciitilde}15-40 galaxies Mpc-2. At odds with low-z results, at high z the relation between star-forming fraction and local density varies from high- to low-mass clusters. Overall, our results suggest that at high z the current star formation ({SF)} activity in star-forming galaxies does not depend strongly on global or local environment, though the possible {SFR} peak seems at odds with this conclusion. We find that the cluster {SFR} normalized by cluster mass anticorrelates with mass and correlates with the star-forming fraction. These trends can be understood given (1) that the average star-forming galaxy forms about 1 M? yr-1 (uncorrected for dust) in all clusters; (2) that the total number of galaxies scales with cluster mass; and (3) the dependence of star-forming fraction on cluster mass. We present the morphology-density ({MD)} relation for our --{\textgreater}z = 0.4 - 0.8 clusters, and uncover that the decline of the spiral fraction with density is entirely driven by galaxies of type Sc or later. For galaxies of a given Hubble type, we see no evidence that {SF} properties depend on local environment. In contrast with recent findings at low z, in our distant clusters the {SF-density} relation and the {MD} relation are equivalent, suggesting that neither of the two is more fundamental than the other.},

Taken collectively, the morphology-density relationship, T - $\Sigma$, for these more distant, presumably younger clusters is qualitatively similar to that found for the local sample, but a detailed comparison shows two substantial differences: (1) For the clusters in our sample, the T - $\Sigma$ relation is strong in centrally concentrated regular clusters, those with a strong correlation of radius and surface density, but nearly absent for clusters that are less concentrated and irregular, in contrast to the situation for low-redshift clusters, where a strong relation has been found for both. (2) In every cluster the fraction of elliptical galaxies is as large or larger than in low-redshift clusters, but the S0 fraction is 2-3 times smaller, with a proportional increase of the spiral fraction. Straightforward, though probably not unique, interpretations of these observations are (1) morphological segregation proceeds hierarchically, affecting richer, denser groups of galaxies earlier, and (2) the formation of elliptical galaxies predates the formation of rich clusters and occurs instead in the loose-group phase or even earlier, but S0's are generated in large numbers only after cluster virialization.},

We present the {2D} bulge-disc decomposition of galaxies in deep Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope \$u,g,i\$ imaging using {GALFIT.} Rigorous filtering is applied to identify an analysis sample of 200 galaxies which are well described by an `archetypal' S0 structure (central bulge + outer disc). We consider internal bulge and/or disc colour gradients by allowing component sizes to vary between bands. Gradients are required for \$30{\textbackslash}\%\$ of analysis sample galaxies. Bulge half-light radii are found to be uncorrelated with galaxy luminosity ({\$R\_e} {\textbackslash}sim 1\$ kpc, \$n{\textbackslash}sim2\$) for all but the brightest galaxies ({\$M\_g{\textless}-20.5\$).} The S0 discs are brighter (at fixed size, or smaller at fixed luminosity) than those of star-forming spirals. A similar colour-magnitude relation is found for both bulges and discs. The global red sequence for S0s in Coma hence results from a combination of both component trends. We measure an average bulge \$-\$ disc colour difference of \$0.09{\textbackslash}pm0.01\$ mag in \$g-i\$, and \$0.16{\textbackslash}pm0.01\$ mag in \$u-g\$. Using simple stellar population models, bulges are either \${\textbackslash}sim2\$-\$3{\textbackslash}times\$ older, or \${\textbackslash}sim2{\textbackslash}times\$ more metal-rich than discs. The trend towards bluer global S0 colours observed further from Coma's core is driven by a significant correlation in disc colour with cluster-centric radius. An equivalent trend is detected in bulge colours at a marginal significance level. Our results therefore favour environment-mediated mechanisms of disc fading as the dominant factor in S0 formation.},

Our study adopts techniques that are comparable with those applied at lower redshifts, allowing a direct investigation of how the morphological segregation of galaxies has evolved over the last 8 Gyr. Although the morphology-density relation, as described by the fraction of early-type ({E+S0)} galaxies, was in place at z = 1, its form differs from that observed at both z = 0 and z = 0.5. In the highest density regions the early-type fraction has increased steadily with time from {fE+S0} = 0.7 {\textpm} 0.1 at z = 1 to {fE+S0} = 0.9 {\textpm} 0.1 at the present epoch. However, in intermediate-density regions corresponding to groups and the accretion regions of rich clusters, significant evolution appears to begin only after z = 0.5. Finally, at the lowest densities, no evolution is observed for the early-type fraction of field galaxies, which remains constant at {fE+S0} = 0.4 {\textpm} 0.1 at all epochs. We examine a simple picture consistent with these observations where the early-type population at z = 1 is comprised largely of elliptical galaxies. Subsequent evolution in both intermediate and dense regions is attributed to the transformation of spirals into lenticulars. Further progress in verifying our hypothesis may be achieved through distinguishing ellipticals and lenticulars at these redshifts through resolved dynamical studies of representative systems.},

Attention is given to evidence which contradicts the interpretation that these gradients in population result from the production of S0 galaxies when spirals are swept of disk gas by an {IGM.} In addition, as an alternative to the hypothesis of spiral sweeping, it is suggested that the local density/morphological-type relation reflects the long time scale associated with the formation of the disk component of galaxies. Finally, the data also indicate a trend of increasing luminosity of the spheroidal component with increasing local density.},

Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from "late" galaxy types in underdense regions to "early" galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types -- spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems -- and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys.},

The excess light at large radii (r {\textgreater} r\_brk) can either be caused by an outer exponential disc (Type {III-d)} or an extended spheroidal component (Type {III-s).} Using our comparisons, we determine the contribution of bulge light at r {\textgreater} r\_brk for a large sample of 78 (barred/unbarred, Sa-Sd) spiral galaxies with outer disc antitruncations (mu\_brk {\textgreater} 24 mag arcsec{\textasciicircum}-2). In the majority of cases ({\textasciitilde}85 per cent), evidence indicates that excess light at r {\textgreater} r\_brk is related to an outer shallow disc (Type {III-d).} Here, the contribution of bulge light at r {\textgreater} r\_brk is either negligible ({\textasciitilde}70 per cent) or too little to explain the antitruncation ({\textasciitilde}15 per cent). However in the latter cases, bulge light can affect the measured disc properties (e.g. mu\_brk, outer scalelength). In the remaining cases ({\textasciitilde}15 per cent), light at r {\textgreater} r\_brk is dominated by the bulge (Type {III-s).} Here, for most cases the bulge profile dominates at all radii and only occasionally (3 galaxies, {\textasciitilde}5 per cent) extends beyond that of a dominant disc and explains the excess light at r {\textgreater} r\_brk. We thus conclude that in the vast majority of cases antitruncated outer discs cannot be explained by bulge light and thus remain a pure disc phenomenon.},

This manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of different methods for error estimation that are applicable to both model-based and model-independent parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the methods for error estimation discussed are grid search, varying \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$, the Fisher matrix, Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data resampling, and bootstrapping. Finally, a method is outlined how to propagate measurement errors through complex data-reduction pipelines.},

While field S0 galaxies have disks whose surface-brightness profiles are roughly equally divided between the three main types (Types I, {II}, and {III:} single-exponential, truncated, and antitruncated), Virgo S0s appear to be entirely lacking in disk truncations. More specifically, the fraction of truncations in S0 galaxies with {M\_B} {\textless} -17 is 28\% +7/-6\% for the field, versus 0\% +4/-0\% for the Virgo Cluster galaxies; the difference is significant at the 99.7\% level. The discrepancy is made up almost entirely by Type I profiles, which are almost twice as frequent in the Virgo Cluster as they are in the field. This suggests that S0 formation may be driven by different processes in cluster and field environments, and that outer-disk effects can be useful tests of S0 formation models.},

	abstract = {Numerous methods for finding clusters at moderate to high redshifts have been proposed in recent years, at wavelengths ranging from radio to X-rays. In this paper we describe a new method for detecting clusters in two-band optical/near-{IR} imaging data. The method relies upon the observation that all rich clusters, at all redshifts observed so far, appear to have a red sequence of early-type galaxies. The emerging picture is that all rich clusters contain a core population of passively evolving elliptical galaxies that are coeval and formed at high
redshifts. The proposed search method exploits this strong empirical fact by using the red sequence as a direct indicator of overdensity. The fundamental advantage of this approach is that with appropriate filters, cluster elliptical galaxies at a given redshift are redder than all normal galaxies at lower redshifts. A simple color cut thus virtually eliminates all foreground contamination, even at significant redshifts. In this paper, one of a series of two, we describe the underlying assumptions and basic techniques of the method in detail and contrast the method with those used by other authors. We provide a brief
demonstration of the effectiveness of the technique using a real photometric sample with redshift data, and from this we conclude that the method offers a powerful yet simple way of identify galaxy clusters. We find that the method can reliably detect structures to masses as small as groups with velocity dispersions of only {\textasciitilde}300 km
s-1, with redshifts for all detected structures estimated to an accuracy of {\textasciitilde}10\%.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms which cause galaxies to form and evolve each leave behind distinct structural markers in their wake. Dynamically hot processes (e.g., monolithic collapse, hierarchical merging) give rise to pressure-supported spheroidal structures, including elliptical galaxies and classical bulges. By contrast, dynamically cold processes (e.g., gas accretion, {AGN} splashback) lead to flattened rotationally-supported disk-like structures, often found on their own or as part of a spiral galaxy. If left in isolation for a sufficient length of time, secular evolutionary processes cause the formation of a bar-like structure within the disk, precipitating the genesis of a rotationally-supported pseudo-bulge. Robustly measuring galaxy structure enables us to ascertain the relative importance of these competing evolutionary mechanisms and; in so doing, help broaden our understanding of how the Universe around us came to be.

This thesis explores the relation between galaxy structure, morphology and stellar mass. In the first part I present single-S{\'e}rsic two-dimensional model fits to 167,600 galaxies modelled independently in the {ugrizYJHK} bandpasses using reprocessed Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Seven ({SDSS} {DR7)} and {UKIRT} Infrared Deep Sky Survey Large Area Survey ({UKIDSS} {LAS)} imaging data available via the Galaxy and Mass Assembly ({GAMA)} data base. In order to facilitate this study, we developed Structural Investigation of Galaxies via Model Analysis ({SIGMA):} an automated wrapper around several contemporary astronomy software packages. We confirm that variations in global structural measurements with wavelength arise due to the effects of dust attenuation and stellar population/metallicity gradients within galaxies.

In the second part of this thesis we establish a volume-limited sample of 3,845 galaxies in the local Universe and visually classify these galaxies according to their morphological Hubble type. We find that single-S{\'e}rsic photometry accurately reproduces the morphology luminosity functions predicted in the literature. We employ multi-component S{\'e}rsic profiling to provide bulge-disk decompositions for this sample, allowing for the luminosity and stellar mass to be divided between the key structural components: spheroids and disks. Grouping the stellar mass in these structures by the evolutionary mechanisms that formed them, we find that hot-mode collapse, merger or otherwise turbulent mechanisms account for {\textasciitilde}46\% of the total stellar mass budget, cold-mode gas accretion and splashback mechanisms account for {\textasciitilde}48\% of the total stellar mass budget and secular evolutionary processes for {\textasciitilde}6.5\% of the total stellar mass budget in the local (z{\textless}0.06) Universe.},

	abstract = {We compare the results of various cosmological gas-dynamical codes used to simulate the formation of a galaxy in the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter structure formation paradigm. The various runs (13 in total) differ in their numerical hydrodynamical treatment [smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH)}, moving mesh and adaptive mesh refinement] but share the same initial conditions and adopt in each case their latest published model of gas cooling, star formation and feedback. Despite the common halo assembly history, we find large code-to-code variations in the stellar mass, size, morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z= 0, due mainly to the different implementations of star formation and feedback. Compared with observation, most codes tend to produce an overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas rich than typical spirals, with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. A stellar disc is discernible in most simulations, although its prominence varies widely from code to code. There is a well-defined trend between the effects of feedback and the severity of the disagreement with observed spirals. In general, models that are more effective at limiting the baryonic mass of the galaxy come closer to matching observed galaxy scaling laws, but often to the detriment of the disc component. Although numerical convergence is not particularly good for any of the codes, our conclusions hold at two different numerical resolutions. Some differences can also be traced to the different numerical techniques; for example, more gas seems able to cool and become available for star formation in grid-based codes than in {SPH.} However, this effect is small compared to the variations induced by different feedback prescriptions. We conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yet uniquely predict the properties of the baryonic component of a galaxy, even when the assembly history of its host halo is fully specified. Developing feedback algorithms that can effectively regulate the mass of a galaxy without hindering the formation of high angular momentum stellar discs remains a challenge.},

Our results are as follows. (1) Our H-band bar fraction ({\textasciitilde}58\%) is consistent with that from ellipse fits. (2) 70\% of the stellar mass is in disks, 10\% in bars, and 20\% in bulges. (3) A large fraction ({\textasciitilde}69\%) of bright spirals have {B/T<=} 0.2, and {\textasciitilde}76\% have low n <= 2 bulges. These bulges exist in barred and unbarred galaxies across a wide range of Hubble types. (4) About 65\% (68\%) of bright spirals with n <= 2 ({B/T} <= 0.2) bulges host bars, suggesting a possible link between bars and bulges. (5) We compare the results with predictions from a set of {$\Lambda$CDM} models. In the models, a high-mass spiral can have a bulge with a present-day low {B/T<=} 0.2 only if it did not undergo a major merger since z <= 2. The predicted fraction ({\textasciitilde} 1.6\%) of high-mass spirals, which have undergone a major merger since z <= 4 and host a bulge with a present-day low {B/T} <= 0.2, is a factor of over 30 smaller than the observed fraction ({\textasciitilde}66\%) of high-mass spirals with {B/T} <= 0.2. Thus, contrary to common perception, bulges built via major mergers since z <= 4 seriously fail to account for the bulges present in {\textasciitilde}66\% of high mass spirals. Most of these present-day low {B/T} <= 0.2 bulges are likely to have been built by a combination of minor mergers and/or secular processes since z <= 4.},

We here propose that the major mechanism for the S0 creation is galaxy merging between two spirals with unequal mass. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that galaxy merging exhausts a large amount of the interstellar medium of two gas-rich spirals, owing to the moderately enhanced star formation, and subsequently transforms the two into one gas-poor S0 galaxy with a structure and kinematics strikingly similar to the observed ones. This secondary S0 formation with enhanced star formation explains the smaller fraction of the S0 population recently observed in some distant clusters of galaxies. Unequal-mass galaxy mergers thus provide an evolutionary link between a larger number of blue spirals observed in
intermediate-redshift clusters and the red S0's prevalent in the present-day ones.},

We develop techniques for bar detection, and assess their success when applied to {SDSS} image data. To detect and characterise bars we perform {2D} bulge+disk+bar light decompositions of galaxy images with {GALFIT.} Using a sample of artificial galaxy images we determine the faintest magnitude at which bars can be successfully measured at the depth and resolution of {SDSS.} We perform detailed decompositions of 83 S0 galaxies in Coma, 64 from a central sample, and 19 from a cluster outskirts sample. For the central sample, the S0 bar fraction is 72{\textasciicircum}\{+5\}\_\{-6\}\%. This value is significantly higher than that obtained using an ellipse fitting method for bar detection, 48{\textasciicircum}\{+6\}\_\{-6\}\%. At a fixed luminosity, barred S0s are redder in (g-r) colour than unbarred S0s by 0.02 mag. The frequency and strength of bars increase towards fainter luminosities. Neither central metallicity nor stellar age distributions differ significantly between barred and unbarred S0s. There is an increase in the bar fraction towards the cluster core, but this is at a low significance level. Bars have at most a weak correlation with cluster-centric radius.},

	abstract = {We have performed {2D} bulge/bar/disc decompositions using g, r and i-band images of a representative sample of nearly 1000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that the Petrosian concentration index is a better proxy for bulge-to-total ratio than the global Sersic index. We show that pseudo-bulges can be distinguished from classical bulges as outliers in the Kormendy relation. We provide the structural parameters and distributions of stellar masses of ellipticals, classical bulges, pseudo-bulges, discs and bars, and find that 32 per cent of the total stellar mass in massive galaxies in the local universe is contained in ellipticals, 36 per cent in discs, 25 per cent in classical bulges, 3 per cent in pseudo-bulges and 4 per cent in bars. Pseudo-bulges are currently undergoing intense star formation activity and populate the blue cloud of the colour-magnitude diagram. Most (though not all) classical bulges are quiescent and populate the red sequence of the diagram. Classical bulges follow a correlation between bulge Sersic index and bulge-to-total ratio, while pseudo-bulges do not. In addition, for a fixed bulge-to-total ratio, pseudo-bulges are less concentrated than classical bulges. Pseudo-bulges follow a mass-size relation similar to that followed by bars, and different from that followed by classical bulges. In the fundamental plane, pseudo-bulges occupy the same locus as discs. While these results point out different formation processes for classical and pseudo-bulges, we also find a significant overlap in their properties, indicating that the different processes might happen concomitantly. Finally, classical bulges and ellipticals follow offset mass-size relations, suggesting that high-mass bulges might not be simply high-mass ellipticals surrounded by discs.},

The majority of stellar images are rejected by the regularity of their image surface brightness profiles. Remaining images are inspected by eye on film copies of the survey material and classed as stellar, multiple stellar, galaxy, merger or noise. Galaxies are further classified as elliptical, lenticular, spiral, irregular or uncertain. The 180 survey fields are put onto a uniform photometric system by comparing the magnitudes of galaxies in the overlap regions between neighbouring plates. The magnitude zero-point, photometric uniformity and photographic saturation are checked with {CCD} photometry.

Supplementing our dataset with previously published data, we create a combined sample of 29 Coma S0s, as well as a comparison sample of 38 Coma spirals. Using photometry from {SDSS} and {2MASS}, we construct the Tully-Fisher relation ({TFR;} luminosity versus maximum rotational velocity) for S0 galaxies. At fixed rotational velocity, the Coma S0 galaxies are on average fainter than Coma spirals by 1.10\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.18, 0.86\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.19 and 0.83\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.19 mag in the g, i and Ks bands respectively. The typical S0 offsets remain unchanged when calculated relative to large field-galaxy spiral samples. The observed offsets are consistent with a simple star formation model in which S0s are identical to spirals until abrupt quenching occurs at some intermediate redshift. The offsets form a continuous distribution tracing the time since the cessation of star formation, and exhibit a strong correlation ({\textgreater}6\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}) with residuals from the optical colour-magnitude relation. Typically, S0s which are fainter than average for their rotational velocity are also redder than average for their luminosity. The S0 {TFR} offset is also correlated with both the projected cluster-centric radius and the \{{\textbackslash}Sigma\} (projected) local density parameter. Since current local environment is correlated with time of accretion into the cluster, our results support a scenario in which transformation of spirals to S0s is triggered by cluster infall.},

	abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

	abstract = {Mean ages and metal abundances are estimated for the stellar populations in a sample of 115 E and S0 galaxies in the central 64 arcmin {\texttimes} 70 arcmin of the Coma cluster. The estimates are based on the absorption line indices Mg2, {\textless}Fe{\textgreater} and {H$\beta$G}, and the mass-to-light ratios ({M/L).} Single stellar population models from Vazdekis et al. were used to transform from the measured line indices and {M/L} ratios to mean ages and mean metal abundances ([{Mg/H]} and [{Fe/H]).} The non-solar abundance ratios [{Mg/Fe]} were taken into account by assuming that for a given age and iron abundance, a [{Mg/Fe]} different from solar will affect the Mg2 index but not the {M/L} ratio or the {\textless}Fe{\textgreater} and {H$\beta$G} indices. The derived ages and abundances are the luminosity-weighted mean values for the stellar populations in the {galaxies.By} comparing the mean ages derived from the {Mg2{\textendash}H$\beta$G} diagram with those derived from the {Mg2{\textendash}M/L} diagram, we estimate the variations of the fraction of dark matter. Alternatively, the difference between the two estimates of the mean age may be caused by variations in the initial mass function or any non-homology of the {galaxies.The} distributions of the derived mean ages and abundances show that there are real variations in both the mean ages and the abundances. We find an intrinsic rms scatter of [{Mg/H]}, [{Fe/H]} and [{Mg/Fe]} of 0.2 dex, and an intrinsic rms scatter of the derived ages of 0.17 dex. The magnesium abundances [{Mg/H]} and the abundance ratios [{Mg/Fe]} are both strongly correlated with the central velocity dispersions of the galaxies, while the iron abundances [{Fe/H]} are uncorrelated with the velocity dispersions. Further, [{Mg/H]} and [{Fe/H]} are strongly anticorrelated with the mean ages of the galaxies. This is not the case for [{Mg/Fe].We} have tested whether the slopes of the scaling relations between the global parameters for the galaxies (the Mg2{\textendash}$\sigma$ relation, the {\textless}Fe{\textgreater}{\textendash}$\sigma$ relation, the {H$\beta$G{\textendash}$\sigma$} relation and the Fundamental Plane) are consistent with the relation between the ages, the abundances and the velocity dispersions. We find that all the slopes, except the slope of the Fundamental Plane, can be explained in a consistent way as resulting from a combination between variations of the mean ages and the mean abundances as functions of the velocity dispersions. The slope of the Fundamental Plane is {\textquoteleft}steeper{\textquoteright} than predicted from the variations in the ages and {abundances.Because} of the correlation between the mean ages and the mean abundances, substantial variations in the ages and the abundances are possible while maintaining a low scatter of all the scaling relations. When this correlation is taken into account, the observed scatter of the scaling relations is consistent with the rms scatter in the derived ages and abundances at a given velocity dispersion.},

	abstract = {We use integral field spectroscopy of 13 disk galaxies in the cluster {AC114} at z {\textasciitilde} 0.31 in an attempt to disentangle the physical processes responsible for the transformation of spiral galaxies in clusters. Our sample is selected to display a dominant young stellar population, as indicated by strong Hdelta absorption lines in their integrated spectra. Most of our galaxies lack the [{OII]} emission line, and hence ongoing star formation. They therefore possess `k+a' spectra, indicative of a recent truncation of star formation, possibly preceded by a starburst. Disky `k+a' galaxies are a promising candidate for the intermediate stage of the transformation from star-forming spiral galaxies to passive S0s. Our observations allow us to study the spatial distributions and the kinematics of the different stellar populations within the galaxies. We used three different indicators to evaluate the presence of a young population: the equivalent width of Hdelta, the luminosity-weighted fraction of A stars, and the fraction of the galaxy light attributable to simple stellar populations with ages between 0.5 and 1.5 Gyr. We find a mixture of behaviours, but are able to show that in most of galaxies the last episode of star-formation occured in an extended disk, similar to preceeding generations of stars, though somewhat more centrally concentrated. We thus exclude nuclear starbursts and violent gravitational interactions as causes of the star formation truncation. Gentler mechanisms, such as ram-pressure stripping or weak galaxy-galaxy interactions, appear to be responsible for ending star-formation in these intermediate-redshift cluster disk galaxies.},

Telescope {FORS2} images of eighteen, optically-selected galaxy clusters at 0.45 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.80 observed as part of the {ESO} Distant Cluster
Survey ({{\textquotedblleft}EDisCS{\textquotedblright}).} Morphological content is characterized by
the early-type galaxy fraction f\_et, and early-type galaxies are objectively selected based on their bulge fraction and image smoothness. This quantitative selection is equivalent to selecting galaxies visually classified as E or S0. Changes in early-type fractions as a function of cluster velocity dispersion, redshift and star-formation activity are studied. A set of 158 clusters extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is analyzed exactly as the distant {EDisCS} sample to provide a robust local comparison. We also compare our results to a set of clusters from the Millennium Simulation. Our main results are: (1) the early-type fractions of the {SDSS} and {EDisCS} clusters exhibit no clear trend as a function of cluster velocity dispersion. (2) Mid-z {EDisCS} clusters around $\sigma$ = 500 km s-1 have f\_et ? 0.5
whereas high-z {EDisCS} clusters have f\_et ? 0.4. This represents a {\textasciitilde}25\% increase over a time interval of 2 Gyr. (3) There is a marked difference in the morphological content of {EDisCS} and {SDSS} clusters. None of the {EDisCS} clusters have early-type galaxy fractions greater than 0.6 whereas half of the {SDSS} clusters lie above this value. This difference is seen in clusters of all velocity dispersions. (4) There is a strong and clear correlation between morphology and star formation activity in {SDSS} and {EDisCS} clusters in the sense that decreasing fractions of [{OII]} emitters are tracked by increasing early-type fractions. This correlation holds independent of cluster velocity dispersion and redshift even though the fraction of [{OII]} emitters decreases from z \~{}0.8 to z \~{} 0.06 in all environments. Our
results pose an interesting challenge to structural transformation and star formation quenching processes that strongly depend on the global cluster environment (e.g., a dense {ICM)} and suggest that cluster membership may be of lesser importance than other variables in
determining galaxy properties.

21.8{\textpm}0.6 J-mag arcsec-2 (mean and standard deviation). This is not produced by sample selection effects. (2) The bivariate distribution function of $\mu$0 and scalelength h shows that the mean value of $\mu$0 changes from about 21.5 at h =
5 kpc to about 22 - 22.5 at h = 1 kpc. The most abundant galaxy in the universe has $\mu$0 = 22.5 J-mag arcsec-2
and h = 1 kpc. (3) The small spread in $\mu$0 in the
universe is probably a result of a constant ratio of visible to dark matter in all galaxies, if galaxies collapse with detailed conservation of angular momentum from uniformly rotating, uniform spheres that derive their angular momentum from tidal torques in a universe with
hierarchical clustering. This model also explains the approximate exponential nature and the cut-offs in the stellar disk at about 4.5 scalelengths.},

velocity (the Tully-Fisher [{TF]} relation), in the g, r, i, and z bands,
for a broadly selected sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, with the goal of providing well-defined observational
constraints for theoretical models of galaxy formation. The input sample
of 234 galaxies has a roughly flat distribution of absolute magnitudes
in the range -18.5 {\textgreater} Mr {\textgreater} -22, and our only
morphological selection is an isophotal axis ratio cut b/a {\textless} 0.6 to
allow accurate inclination corrections. Long-slit spectroscopy from the
Calar Alto and {MDM} observatories yields usable H$\alpha$ rotation curves
for 162 galaxies (69\%), with a representative color and morphology
distribution. We define circular velocities V80 by evaluating
the rotation curve at the radius containing 80\% of the i-band light.
Observational errors, including estimated distance errors due to
peculiar velocities, are small compared to the intrinsic scatter of the
{TF} relation. The slope of the forward {TF} relation steepens from -5.5
{\textpm} 0.2 mag (log10 km s-1)-1 in
the g band to -6.6 {\textpm} 0.2 mag (log10 km
s-1)-1 in the z band. The intrinsic scatter is
$\sigma$ approx 0.4 mag in all bands, and residuals from either the
forward or inverse relations have an approximately Gaussian
distribution. We discuss how Malmquist-type biases may affect the
observed slope, intercept, and scatter. The scatter is not dominated by
rare outliers or by any particular class of galaxies, although it drops
slightly, to $\sigma$ approx 0.36 mag, if we restrict the sample to
nearly bulgeless systems. Correlations of {TF} residuals with other galaxy
properties are weak: bluer galaxies are significantly brighter than
average in the g-band {TF} relation but only marginally brighter in the i
band; more concentrated (earlier type) galaxies are slightly fainter
than average, and the {TF} residual is virtually independent of half-light
radius, contrary to the trend expected for gravitationally dominant
disks. The observed residual correlations do not account for most of the
intrinsic scatter, implying that this scatter is instead driven largely
by variations in the ratio of dark to luminous matter within the disk
galaxy population.},

	abstract = {We present a two-dimensional fitting algorithm ({GALFIT)} designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the {``Nuker''} law, the S{\'e}rsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei.

	abstract = {Based on our sample of 10095 galaxies with bulge-disc decompositions we derive the empirical B-band internal attenuation--inclination relation for galaxy discs and their associated central bulges. Our results agree well with the independently derived dust models of Tuffs et al., leading to a direct constraint on the mean opacity of spiral discs of {Tau\_B{\textasciicircum}f} = 3.8 +/- 0.7 (central face-on B-band opacity). Depending on inclination, the B-band attenuation correction varies from 0.2 -- 1.1 mag for discs and from 0.8 -- 2.6 mag for bulges. We find that, overall, 37 per cent of all B-band photons produced in discs in the nearby universe are absorbed by dust, a figure that rises to 71 per cent for bulge photons. The severity of internal dust extinction is such that one must incorporate internal dust corrections in all optical studies of large galaxy samples. This is particularly pertinent for optical {HST} comparative evolutionary studies as the dust properties will also be evolving. We use the new results to revise our recent estimates of the spheroid and disc luminosity functions. From our best fitting dust models we derive a redshift zero cosmic dust density of rho\_\{dust\} {\textasciitilde} (5.3 +/- 1.7) x 10{\textasciicircum}5, h M\_\{odot\} Mpc{\textasciicircum}-3. This implies that (0.0083 +/- 0.0027), h per cent of the baryons in the Universe are in the form of dust and (11.9 +/- 1.7), h per cent (Salpeter-`lite' {IMF)} are in the form of stars ({\textasciitilde}58 per cent reside in galaxy discs, {\textasciitilde}10 per cent in red elliptical galaxies, {\textasciitilde}29 per cent in classical galaxy bulges and the remainder in low luminosity blue spheroid systems/components).

The simulation includes star formation and effects of stellar feedback. In our simulation a stellar disk forms with a surface density profile consisting of an inner exponential breaking to a steeper outer exponential. The break forms early on and persists throughout the evolution, moving outward as more gas is able to cool and add mass to the disk. The parameters of the break are in excellent agreement with observations. The break corresponds to a rapid drop in the star formation rate associated with a drop in the cooled gas surface density, but the outer exponential is populated by stars that were scattered outward on nearly circular orbits from the inner disk by spiral arms. The resulting profile and its associated break are therefore a consequence of the interplay between a radial star formation cutoff and redistribution of stellar mass by secular processes. A consequence of such evolution is a sharp change in the radial mean stellar age profile at the break radius.},

	abstract = {It is widely believed that lenticular (S0) galaxies were initially spirals from which the gas has been removed by interactions with hot cluster gas, or by ram pressure stripping of cool gas from spirals that are orbiting within rich clusters of galaxies. However, problems with this interpretation are that (1) some lenticulars, such as {NGC} 3115, are isolated field galaxies rather than cluster members. (2) The distribution of flattening values of S0 galaxies in clusters, in groups, and in the field are statistically indistinguishable. This is surprising because one might have expected most of the progenitors of field S0 galaxies to have been flattened late-type galaxies, whereas lenticulars in clusters are thought to have mostly been derived from bulge-dominated early-type galaxies. (3) It should be hardest for ram pressure to strip massive luminous galaxies with deep potential wells. However, no statistically significant differences are seen between the luminosity distributions of early-type Shapley-Ames galaxies in clusters, groups, and in the field. (4) Finally both ram pressure stripping and evaporation by hot intracluster gas would be most efficient in rich clusters. However, the small number of available data in the Shapley-Ames sample appears to show no statistically significant differences between the relative frequencies of dust-poor S01 and dust-rich S03 galaxies in clusters, groups, and in the field. It is tentatively concluded that ram pressure stripping and heating by intracluster gas, may not be the only evolutionary channels that lead to the formation of lenticular galaxies. It is speculated that gas starvation, or gas ejection by active nuclei, may have played a major role in the formation of a significant fraction of all S0 galaxies.},

	abstract = {We report results from the {BICEP2} experiment, a Cosmic Microwave Background ({CMB)} polarimeter specifically designed to search for the signal of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum around l=80. The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition edge sensor ({TES)} 150 {GHz} bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of approx. 300 uk.sqrt(s). {BICEP2} observed from the South Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with an effective area of 380 square degrees was observed to a depth of 87 {nK-degrees} in Stokes Q and U. In this paper we describe the observations, data reduction, maps, simulations and results. We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-{LCDM} expectation in the range 30{\textless}l{\textless}150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of \${\textgreater}5{\textbackslash}sigma\$. Through jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the observed excess. We also estimate potential foreground signals and find that available models predict these to be considerably smaller than the observed signal. These foreground models possess no significant cross-correlation with our maps. Additionally, cross-correlating {BICEP2} against 100 {GHz} maps from the {BICEP1} experiment, the excess signal is confirmed with \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the {CMB}, disfavoring synchrotron or dust at \$2.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ and \$2.2{\textbackslash}sigma\$, respectively. The observed B-mode power spectrum is well-fit by a lensed-{LCDM} + tensor theoretical model with tensor/scalar ratio \$r=0.20{\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.05\}\$, with r=0 disfavored at \$7.0{\textbackslash}sigma\$. Subtracting the best available estimate for foreground dust modifies the likelihood slightly so that r=0 is disfavored at \$5.9{\textbackslash}sigma\$.},

observed in {BVRI} bands are analysed, and the derived parameters obtained
by the R1/4-law and exponential bulge models are compared
with the sample of normal galaxies reported by de Jong \& van der
Kruit in 1994. Some characteristic properties of the intensity profiles
are then interpreted by {3D} N-body simulations, in which both components
of the pair are described by an exponential star+gas disc embedded in a
live bulge and halo. The disc central surface brightness
$\mu$0 was found to be similar for the M51-type and for normal
galaxies, being 21.5+/-{0.8Bmagarcsec-2}, when the exponential
bulge model was used. The main galaxies had generally almost normal
photometric properties, whereas for the companions secular evolution
must have played an important role. Even though the mean scalelengths
for the M51-type galaxies were smaller than for the comparison galaxies,
their bulges were larger: especially the companions had extremely large
bulge sizes relative to their disc scalelengths having
e(bulge)/h{\textgreater} (B)=0.37+/-0.10 in comparison with
0.15+/-0.09 for normal galaxies. Consequently, the bulge-to-disc
luminosity ratios for the companions were also generally larger than
known for any of the Hubble types of normal galaxy. N-body simulations
indicated that the inner disc can be steepened during the interaction,
and that this steepened disc can be erroneously interpreted as belonging
to the bulge. Simultaneously material in the outer disc is
redistributed, producing shallow outer profiles similar to those
observed for typical M51-type galaxies. These processes were
demonstrated by applying photometric bulge-to-disc decompositions for
some of the simulated intensity profiles. The decompositions also showed
that one must be cautious when applying the R1/4-law bulge
model, especially for interacting galaxies. A nearly parabolic
experiment showed that the redistribution of matter in the disc during
the close passage can be long-lived, suggesting that galaxy interactions
even with small companions may play an important role in secular
evolution for galaxies in clusters.},

We split the sample into bright and faint S0 galaxies based on their K band luminosity. Comparing the {FUV-NUV} versus {NUV-K} color-color diagram with a Simple Stellar Population ({SSP)} model shows that ellipticals and bright S0 galaxies are dominated by a stellar population of age {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}9 years while faint S0 galaxies may contain stars as young as 10{\textasciicircum}8 years, providing evidence for relatively recent star formation activity. The strength of the {4000A} break is also systematically higher in brighter S0 galaxies, again indicating the presence of an old stellar population. Their mid-{IR} colours indicate that bright S0 colours are like those of ellipticals while faint S0 colours are more like spirals. All these observations are consistent with a scenario in which low-luminosity S0 galaxies likely formed by the stripping of gas from the discs of late-type spiral galaxies, which in turn formed their pseudo bulges through secular evolution processes, possibly involving multiple episodes of star formation. On the other hand, more luminous S0 galaxies likely formed the bulk of their stars at early epochs, similar to the star formation in elliptical galaxies, and are characterised by an old coeval stellar population and classical bulge},

The observed luminosity-radius-metallicity relations are found to be produced naturally inside dominant halos, with a mass-radius relation that resembles the predictions of the "cold" dark matter cosmological scenario. The critical condition for global gas loss as a result of the first burst of star formation is that the virial velocity be below a critical value on the order of 100 km s-1. In any hierarchial scenario for galaxy formation, this condition leads to two distinct classes of galaxies as observed: (1) the diffuse dwarfs which mostly originate from typical density perturbations; and (2) the normal, brighter galaxies which can originate only from the highest density peaks. This provides a statistical biasing mechanism for the preferential formation of bright galaxies in denser regions (clusters and superclusters).},

	abstract = {In the light of several recent developments we revisit the phenomenon of galactic stellar disk truncations. Even 25 years since the first paper on outer breaks in the radial light profiles of spiral galaxies, their origin is still unclear. The two most promising explanations are that these 'outer edges' either trace the maximum angular momentum during the galaxy formation epoch, or are associated with global star formation thresholds. Depending on their true physical nature, these outer edges may represent an improved size characteristic (e.g., as compared to D\_25) and might contain fossil evidence imprinted by the galaxy formation and evolutionary history. We will address several observational aspects of disk truncations: their existence, not only in normal {HSB} galaxies, but also in {LSB} and even dwarf galaxies; their detailed shape, not sharp cut-offs as thought before, but in fact demarcating the start of a region with a steeper exponential distribution of starlight; their possible association with bars; as well as problems related to the line-of-sight integration for edge-on galaxies (the main targets for truncation searches so far). Taken together, these observations currently favour the star-formation threshold model, but more work is necessary to implement the truncations as adequate parameters characterising galactic disks.},

	abstract = {We have performed two-dimensional multicomponent decomposition of 144 
local barred spiral galaxies using 3.6 $\mu$m images from the Spitzer
Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies. Our model fit includes up to
four components (bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most
importantly, takes into account disk breaks. We find that ignoring the
disk break and using a single disk scale length in the model fit for
Type {II} (down-bending) disk galaxies can lead to differences of 40\% in
the disk scale length, 10\% in bulge-to-total luminosity ratio ({B/T)}, and
25\% in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. We find that for galaxies with
{B/T} {\textgreater}= 0.1, the break radius to bar radius, r {br/R}
bar, varies between 1 and 3, but as a function of {B/T} the
ratio remains roughly constant. This suggests that in bulge-dominated
galaxies the disk break is likely related to the outer Lindblad
resonance of the bar and thus moves outward as the bar grows. For
galaxies with small bulges, {B/T} {\textless} 0.1, r {br/R}
bar spans a wide range from 1 to 6. This suggests that the
mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be different
from that in galaxies with more massive bulges. Consistent with previous
studies, we conclude that disk breaks in galaxies with small bulges may
originate from bar resonances that may be also coupled with the spiral
arms, or be related to star formation thresholds.},

	title = {Planetary Nebula Spectrograph survey of S0 galaxy kinematics. {II.} Clues to the origins of S0 galaxies},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1382},
	abstract = {The stellar kinematics of the spheroids and discs of S0 galaxies contain clues to their formation histories. Unfortunately, it is difficult to disentangle the two components and to recover their stellar kinematics in the faint outer parts of the galaxies using conventional absorption line spectroscopy. This paper therefore presents the stellar kinematics of six S0 galaxies derived from observations of planetary nebulae ({PNe)}, obtained using the Planetary Nebula Spectrograph. To separate the kinematics of the two components, we use a maximum-likelihood method that combines the discrete kinematic data with a photometric component decomposition. The results of this analysis reveal that: the discs of S0 galaxies are rotationally supported; however, the amount of random motion in these discs is systematically higher than in comparable spiral galaxies; and the S0s lie around one magnitude below the Tully--Fisher relation for spiral galaxies, while their spheroids lie nearly one magnitude above the Faber--Jackson relation for ellipticals. All of these findings are consistent with a scenario in which spirals are converted into S0s through a process of mild harassment or "pestering," with their discs somewhat heated and their spheroid somewhat enhanced by the conversion process. In such a scenario, one might expect the properties of S0s to depend on environment. We do not see such an effect in this fairly small sample, although any differences would be diluted by the fact that the current location does not necessarily reflect the environment in which the transformation occurred. Similar observations of larger samples probing a broader range of environments, coupled with more detailed modelling of the transformation process to match the wide range of parameters that we have shown can now be measured, should take us from these first steps to the definitive answer as to how S0 galaxies form.},

Our result supports previous theoretical predictions for a bar rotating within a massive halo. On the other hand, low-density halos, such as those required for maximum disks, allow the bar to continue to rotate at a high rate. There is somewhat meager observational evidence indicating that bars in real galaxies do rotate rapidly, and we use our result to argue that dark matter halos must have a low central density in all high surface brightness disk galaxies, including the Milky Way. Bars in galaxies that have larger fractions of dark matter should rotate slowly, and we suggest that a promising place to look for such candidate objects is among galaxies of intermediate surface brightness.},

	abstract = {We update van den Bergh's parallel sequence galaxy classification in which S0 galaxies form a sequence S0a-S0b-S0c that parallels the sequence Sa-Sb-Sc of spiral galaxies. The ratio {B/T} of bulge to total light defines the position of a galaxy in each sequence. Our classification makes one improvement. We extend the S0a-S0b-S0c sequence to spheroidal ({"Sph'")} galaxies that are positioned in parallel to irregular galaxies in a similarly extended Sa-Sb-Sc-Im sequence. This provides a natural "home" for spheroidals, which previously were omitted from galaxy classifications. To motivate our juxtaposition of Sph and irregular galaxies, we present photometry and bulge-disk decompositions of Virgo S0s, including late-type S0s that bridge the gap between S0b and Sph galaxies. {NGC} 4762 is a {SB0bc} with {B/T} = 0.13. {NGC} 4452 is a {SB0c} galaxy with an even tinier pseudobulge. {VCC} 2048 and {NGC} 4638 have properties of both S0cs and Sphs. We update the structural parameter correlations Sphs, irregulars, bulges, and disks. We show that spheroidals of increasing luminosity form a continuous sequence with the disks (but not bulges) of S0c-S0b-S0a galaxies. Remarkably, the Sph--S0-disk sequence is almost identical to that of irregular galaxies and spiral galaxy disks. We review published observations for galaxy transformation processes, particularly ram-pressure stripping of cold gas. We suggest that Sph galaxies are transformed, "red and dead" Scd--Im galaxies in the same way that many S0 galaxies are transformed, red and dead Sa-Sc spiral galaxies},

	abstract = {We follow the evolution of disc galaxies within a cluster that forms hierarchically in a cold dark matter N-body simulation. At a redshift z=0.5 we select several dark matter haloes that have quiet merger histories and are about to enter the newly forming cluster environment. The haloes are replaced with equilibrium high-resolution model spirals that are constructed to represent examples of low surface brightness ({LSB)} and high surface brightness ({HSB)} galaxies. Varying the disc and halo structural parameters reveals that the response of a spiral galaxy to tidal encounters depends primarily on the potential depth of its mass distribution and the disc scalelength. {LSB} galaxies, characterized by slowly rising rotation curves and large scalelengths, evolve
dramatically under the influence of rapid encounters with substructure and strong tidal shocks from the global cluster potential - galaxy harassment. We find that up to 90 per cent of their stars are tidally stripped, and congregate in large diffuse tails that trace the orbital path of the galaxy and form the diffuse intracluster light. The bound stellar remnants closely resemble the dwarf spheroidals ({dEs)} that populate nearby clusters. {HSB} galaxies are stable to the chaos of cluster formation and tidal encounters. These discs lie well within the tidally limited dark matter haloes, and their potentials are more concentrated. Although very few stars are stripped, the scaleheight of the discs increases substantially and no spiral features remain; we therefore speculate that these galaxies would be identified as S0 galaxies in present-day clusters.},

	abstract = {We construct a large data set of global structural parameters for 1300 field and cluster spiral galaxies and explore the joint distribution of luminosity L, optical rotation velocity V, and disk size R at I- and {2MASS} K-bands. The I- and K-band velocity-luminosity ({VL)} relations have log-slopes of 0.29 and 0.27, respectively with sigma\_ln({VL){\textasciitilde}0.13}, and show a small dependence on color and morphological type in the sense that redder, early-type disk galaxies rotate faster than bluer, later-type disk galaxies for most luminosities. The {VL} relation at I- and K-bands is independent of surface brightness, size and light concentration. The log-slope of the I- and K-band {RL} relations is a strong function of morphology and varies from 0.25 to 0.5. The average dispersion sigma\_ln({RL)} decreases from 0.33 at I-band to 0.29 at K, likely due to the {2MASS} selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies. Measurement uncertainties are sigma\_ln(V){\textasciitilde}0.09, sigma\_ln(L){\textasciitilde}0.14 and somewhat larger and harder to estimate for ln(R). The color dependence of the {VL} relation is consistent with expectations from stellar population synthesis models. The {VL} and {RL} residuals are largely uncorrelated with each other; the {RV-RL} residuals show only a weak positive correlation. These correlations suggest that scatter in luminosity is not a significant source of the scatter in the {VL} and {RL} relations. The observed scaling relations can be understood in the context of a model of disk galaxies embedded in dark matter halos that invokes low mean spin parameters and dark halo expansion, as we describe in our companion paper (Dutton et al. 2007). We discuss in two appendices various pitfalls of standard analytical derivations of galaxy scaling relations, including the Tully-Fisher relation with different slopes. (Abridged).},

	abstract = {({ABRIDGED)} We use high resolution ({\textasciitilde}0.1") {F814W} {ACS} images from the {HST} {ACS} Treasury survey of the Coma cluster at z{\textasciitilde}0.02 to study bars in massive disk galaxies (S0s), and in dwarf galaxies in the Coma core. Our study helps constrain the evolution of bars and disks in dense environments and provides a comparison point for studies in lower density environments and at higher redshifts. (1) We characterize the fraction and properties of bars in a sample of 32 bright ({M\_V} {\textless}= -18, M\_* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}9.5 M\_sun) S0 galaxies, which dominate the population of massive disk galaxies in the Coma core. Measuring the S0 bar fraction must be handled carefully, as the results depend on the method used: the bar fraction for bright S0s in the Coma core is 50\%+/-11\%, 65\%+/-11\%, and 60\%+/-11\% for three methods of bar detection: strict ellipse fit criteria, relaxed ellipse fit criteria, and visual classification. (2) We compare the S0 bar fraction across different environments (Coma core, A901/902, Virgo). We find that the bar fraction among bright S0 galaxies does not show a statistically significant variation across environments spanning two orders of magnitude in galaxy number density (n{\textasciitilde}300-10,000 {gal/Mpc{\textasciicircum}3).} We speculate that the S0 bar fraction is not significantly enhanced in rich clusters because S0s in rich clusters are less prone to bar instabilities as they are dynamically hot and gas poor due to ram pressure stripping and accelerated star formation. In addition, high-speed encounters in rich clusters may be less effective than slow, strong encounters in inducing bars. (3) We analyze a sample of 333 faint ({M\_V} {\textgreater} -18) dwarf galaxies in the Coma core. Using unsharp-masking, we find only 13 galaxies with bar and/or spiral structure. The paucity of disk structures in Coma dwarfs suggests that either disks are not common in these galaxies, or that any disks present are too hot to develop instabilities.},

Four different decomposition procedures are investigated which make improvements to sky background determinations and object deblending over the standard {SDSS} procedures that lead to more robust structural parameters and integrated galaxy magnitudes and colors, especially in crowded environments. We use a set of science-based quality assurance metrics namely the disk luminosity-size relation, the galaxy color-magnitude diagram and the galaxy central (fiber) colors to show the robustness of our structural parameters. The best procedure utilizes simultaneous, two-bandpass decompositions. Bulge and disk photometric errors remain below 0.1 mag down to bulge and disk magnitudes of \$g {\textbackslash}simeq 19\$ and \$r {\textbackslash}simeq 18.5\$. We also use and compare three different galaxy fitting models: a pure Sersic model, a \$n\_b=4\$ bulge + disk model and a Sersic (free \$n\_b\$) bulge + disk model. The most appropriate model for a given galaxy is determined by the {\$F\$-test} probability. All three catalogs of measured structural parameters, rest-frame magnitudes and colors are publicly released here. These catalogs should provide an extensive comparison set for a wide range of observational and theoretical studies of galaxies.},

	abstract = {The determination of stellar populations of galaxies are important for 
studying the formation and evolution of galaxies, because all galaxies
contain many stars and they evolve with galaxies. Spectra data are
usually used to determine the stellar populations of nearby galaxies as
they have the ability to disentangle the degeneracy between stellar age
and metallicity. However, it is difficult to give similar studies to
distant (e.g., \$z {\textgreater}\$ 0.3) galaxies because of the lack of reliable
spectra data. This is actually limited by current observational
equipments and methods. In fact, the information of the stellar ages and
metallicities of distant galaxies are crucial for solving the problem of
galaxy formation and evolution. Colours can give us some information of
the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In the paper, I introduce
our works about using colours to estimate the ages and metallicities of
the stellar populations of galaxies. Some potential colours for studying
stellar-population parameters (age and metallicity) and their
sensitivities to stellar-population parameters are reviewed. A new
composite stellar population model that includes both single stars and
binary stars is also introduced.},

	abstract = {Lenticular galaxies have long been thought of as evolved spirals, but the processes involved to quench the star formation are still unclear. By studying the individual star formation histories of the bulges and disks of lenticulars, it is possible to look for clues to the processes that triggered their transformation from spirals. To accomplish this feat, we present a new method for spectroscopic bulge-disk decomposition, in which a long-slit spectrum is decomposed into two one-dimensional spectra representing purely the bulge and disk light. We present preliminary results from applying this method to lenticular galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax Clusters, in which we show that the most recent star formation activity in these galaxies occurred within the bulges. We also find that the bulges are in general more Fe-enriched than the disks of the same galaxy, and that this enrichment grows stronger as the age of the bulge becomes younger. These results point towards a scenario where the star formation in the disks of spiral galaxies are quenched, followed by a burst of star formation in the central regions from the gas that has been funnelled inwards through the disk.},

	abstract = {Evolution of stellar bars in disk galaxies is accompanied by dynamical instabilities and secular changes. Following the vertical buckling instability, the bars are known to weaken dramatically and develop a pronounced boxy/peanut shape when observed edge-on. Using high-resolution N-body simulations of stellar disks embedded in live axisymmetric dark matter halos, we have investigated the long-term changes in the bar morphology, specifically the evolution of the bar size, its vertical structure, and the exchange of angular momentum. We find that following the initial buckling, the bar resumes its growth from deep inside the corotation radius and follows the ultraharmonic resonance thereafter. We also find that this secular bar growth triggers a spectacular secondary vertical buckling instability that leads to the appearance of characteristic {boxy/peanut/X-shaped} bulges. The secular bar growth is crucial for the recurrent buckling to develop. Furthermore, the secondary buckling is milder, persists over a substantial period of time, {\textasciitilde}3 Gyr, and can have observational counterparts. Overall, the stellar bars show recurrent behavior in their properties and evolve by increasing their linear and vertical extents, both dynamically and secularly. We also demonstrate explicitly that the prolonged growth of the bar is mediated by continuous angular momentum transfer from the disk to the surrounding halo and that this angular momentum redistribution is resonant in nature: a large number of lower resonances trap disk and halo particles, and this trapping is robust, in broad agreement with the earlier results in the literature.},

Faint spiral structure becomes visible following galaxy subtraction, and luminous blue stars can be seen in isolated areas of the disk. Dust is visible in the color map in the region around the bar, and there is a linear color gradient throughout the disk. We determine an accurate distance from the surface brightness fluctuation ({SBF)} method, finding --{\textgreater}(m - M) = 31.44 {\textpm} 0.12 mag, or --{\textgreater}d = 19.4 {\textpm} 1.1 Mpc. We then study the globular cluster ({GC)} colors, sizes, and luminosity function ({GCLF).} Estimates of the distance from the median of the {GC} half-light radii and from the peak of the {GCLF} both agree well with the {SBF} distance. The {GC} specific frequency is --{\textgreater}{SN} = 1.3 {\textpm} 0.2, typical for an early-type disk galaxy. The color distribution is bimodal, as commonly observed for bright galaxies. There is a suggestion of the redder {GCs} having smaller sizes, but the trend is not significant. The sizes do increase significantly with galactocentric radius, in a manner more similar to the Milky Way {GC} system than to those in Virgo. This difference may be an effect of the steeper density gradients in loose groups as compared to galaxy clusters. Additional studies of early-type galaxies in low-density regions can help determine if this is indeed a general environmental trend.},

	abstract = {We review internal processes of secular evolution in galaxy disks, concentrating on the buildup of dense central features that look like classical, merger-built bulges but that were made slowly out of disk gas. We call these pseudobulges. As an existence proof, we review how bars rearrange disk gas into outer rings, inner rings, and gas dumped into the center. In simulations, this gas reaches high densities that plausibly feed star formation. In the observations, many {SB} and oval galaxies show central concentrations of gas and star formation. Star formation rates imply plausible pseudobulge growth times of a few billion years. If secular processes built dense central components that masquerade as bulges, can we distinguish them from merger-built bulges? Observations show that pseudobulges retain a memory of their disky origin. They have one or more characteristics of disks: (1) flatter shapes than those of classical bulges, (2) large ratios of ordered to random velocities indicative of disk dynamics, (3) small velocity dispersions, (4) spiral structure or nuclear bars in the bulge part of the light profile, (5) nearly exponential brightness profiles, and (6) starbursts. These structures occur preferentially in barred and oval galaxies in which secular evolution should be rapid. So the cleanest examples of pseudobulges are recognizable. Thus a large variety of observational and theoretical results contribute to a new picture of galaxy evolution that complements hierarchical clustering and merging.},

	abstract = {A new method for spectroscopic bulge-disc decomposition is presented, in which the spatial light profile in a two-dimensional spectrum is decomposed wavelength-by-wavelength into bulge and disc components, allowing separate one-dimensional spectra for each component to be constructed. This method has been applied to observations of a sample of nine S0s in the Fornax Cluster in order to obtain clean high-quality spectra of their individual bulge and disc components. So far this decomposition has only been fully successful when applied to galaxies with clean light profiles, consequently limiting the number of galaxies that could be separated into bulge and disc components. Lick index stellar population analysis of the component spectra reveals that in those galaxies where the bulge and disc could be distinguished, the bulges have systematically higher metallicities and younger stellar populations than the discs. This correlation is consistent with a picture in which S0 formation comprises the shutting down of star formation in the disc accompanied by a final burst of star formation in the bulge. The variation in spatial-fit parameters with wavelength also allows us to measure approximate colour gradients in the individual components. Such gradients were detected separately in both bulges and discs, in the sense that redder light is systematically more centrally concentrated in all components. However, a search for radial variations in the absorption line strengths determined for the individual components revealed that they are absent from the vast majority of S0 discs and bulges. The absence of gradients in line indices for most galaxies implies that the colour gradient cannot be attributed to age or metallicity variations, and is therefore most likely associated with varying degrees of obscuration by dust.},

We compare the Kennicutt [{OII]} and H-alpha {SFR} calibrations and show that there are two significant effects which produce disagreement between {SFR[OII]} and {SFR(H-alpha):} reddening and metallicity. Differences in the ionization state of the {ISM} do not contribute significantly to the observed difference between {SFR([OII])} and {SFR(H-alpha)} for the {NFGS} galaxies with metallicities log({O/H)12{\textgreater}8.5.} The Kennicutt [{OII]-SFR} relation assumes a typical reddening for nearby galaxies; in practice, the reddening differs significantly from sample to sample. We derive a new {SFR([OII])} calibration which does not contain a reddening assumption. Our new {SFR([OII])} calibration also provides an optional correction for metallicity. Our {SFRs} derived from [{OII]} agree with those derived from H-alpha to within 0.03-0.05 dex. We apply our {SFR([OII])} calibration with metallicity correction to two samples: high-redshift 0.8{\textless}z{\textless}1.6 galaxies from the {NICMOS} H-alpha survey, and 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}1.1 galaxies from the Canada-France Redshift Survey. The {SFR([OII])} and {SFR(H-alpha)} for these samples agree to within the scatter observed for the {NFGS} sample, indicating that our {SFR([OII])} relation can be applied to both local and high-z galaxies. Finally, we apply our {SFR([OII])} to estimates of the cosmic star formation history.

Our recent work (Bournaud et al. 2004) shows that the above range of mass ratio results in hybrid systems with spiral-like luminosity profiles but with elliptical-like kinematics, as observed in the data analysis for a sample of mergers by Jog \& Chitre (2002). In this paper, we study the merger-remnants for mass ratios from 1:1 to 10:1 while systematically covering the parameter space. We obtain the morphological and kinematical properties of the remnants, and also discuss the robustness and the visibility of disks in the merger remnants with a random line-of-sight. We show that the mass ratios 1:1-3:1 give rise to elliptical remnants whereas the mass ratios 4.5:1-10:1 produce the hybrid systems with mixed properties. We find that the transition between disk-like and elliptical remnants occurs between a narrow mass-range of 4.5:1-3:1. The unequal-mass mergers are more likely to occur than the standard equal-mass mergers studied in the literature so far, and we discuss their implications for the evolution of galaxies.},

We find that bars are hosted by galaxies in a tight range of both luminosities (\$-22 {\textbackslash}lesssim\$ M\$\_\{r\} {\textbackslash}lesssim -17\$) and masses (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{9\} {\textbackslash}lesssim \{{\textbackslash}cal M\_\{*\}\}/\{{\textbackslash}cal M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}sun\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$). This result holds when comparing with a sample of bright/massive field galaxies. In addition, we find that the bar fraction does not vary significantly when going from the center to the cluster outskirts, implying that cluster environment plays a second order role in bar formation/evolution. The shape of the bar fraction distribution with respect to both luminosity and mass is well matched by the luminosity distribution of disk galaxies in Coma, indicating that bars are good tracers of cold stellar disks. We discuss the implications of our results for the formation and evolution scenarios of bars and disks.},

	abstract = {To better understand the prevalence of bulgeless galaxies in the nearby 
field, we dissect giant Sc-Scd galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope
({HST)} photometry and Hobby-Eberly Telescope ({HET)} spectroscopy. We use
the {HET} High Resolution Spectrograph (resolution R = {$\lambda$/FWHM}
{\textasciitilde}= 15, 000) to measure stellar velocity dispersions in the nuclear star
clusters and (pseudo)bulges of the pure-disk galaxies M 33, M 101, {NGC}
3338, {NGC} 3810, {NGC} 6503, and {NGC} 6946. The dispersions range from 20
{\textpm} 1 km s-1 in the nucleus of M 33 to 78 {\textpm} 2 km
s-1 in the pseudobulge of {NGC} 3338. We use {HST} archive images
to measure the brightness profiles of the nuclei and (pseudo)bulges in M
101, {NGC} 6503, and {NGC} 6946 and hence to estimate their masses. The
results imply small mass-to-light ratios consistent with young stellar
populations. These observations lead to two conclusions. (1) Upper
limits on the masses of any supermassive black holes are M
{\textbullet} {\textless}{\textasciitilde} (2.6 {\textpm} 0.5) {\texttimes} 106 M
sun in M 101 and M {\textbullet} {\textless}{\textasciitilde} (2.0 {\textpm} 0.6)
{\texttimes} 106 M sun in {NGC} 6503. (2) We show that
the above galaxies contain only tiny pseudobulges that make up lsim3\% of
the stellar mass. This provides the strongest constraints to date on the
lack of classical bulges in the biggest pure-disk galaxies. We inventory
the galaxies in a sphere of radius 8 Mpc centered on our Galaxy to see
whether giant, pure-disk galaxies are common or rare. We find that at
least 11 of 19 galaxies with V circ {\textgreater} 150 km
s-1, including M 101, {NGC} 6946, {IC} 342, and our Galaxy, show
no evidence for a classical bulge. Four may contain small classical
bulges that contribute 5\%-12\% of the light of the galaxy. Only four of
the 19 giant galaxies are ellipticals or have classical bulges that
contribute {\textasciitilde}1/3 of the galaxy light. We conclude that pure-disk galaxies
are far from rare. It is hard to understand how bulgeless galaxies could
form as the quiescent tail of a distribution of merger histories.
Recognition of pseudobulges makes the biggest problem with cold dark
matter galaxy formation more acute: How can hierarchical clustering make
so many giant, pure-disk galaxies with no evidence for merger-built
bulges? Finally, we emphasize that this problem is a strong function of
environment: the Virgo cluster is not a puzzle, because more than 2/3 of
its stellar mass is in merger remnants.

	abstract = {We constrain the assembly history of galaxies in the central 0.6 Mpc of the rich Coma cluster at z{\textasciitilde}0.02 based on the structure of 69 massive (M*{\textgreater}1e9 M\_sun) galaxies using images from the {HST} Treasury Survey of Coma. Our findings are: (1) We make no a priori assumptions on the shape of the profile for outer and central structures, which can include disk-dominated components, bars, and classical bulges/ellipticals. After excluding the 2 {cDs}, we find that most (56\%) of the galactic stellar mass resides in classical {bulges/Es} while (44\%) resides in cold disk-dominated structures. This suggests that most of the stellar mass in Coma galaxies may have been assembled and shaped through the redistribution of stars during major mergers, and possibly minor mergers, but that gas-rich dissipative processes that build disk-dominated structures remain important even in the center of a rich cluster like Coma. (2) We see strong evidence of a morphology-density relation. In the central 0.6 Mpc of the Coma cluster, there are 2 {cDs}, spirals are rare, and the morphology breakdown of ({E+S0):spirals} is (22.4\% + 70.2\%):7.4\% by numbers and (28.1\% + 66.2\%):5.7\% by stellar mass. (3) In agreement with earlier work, we find that at a given galaxy stellar mass, the average half-light radius of the outer disk in S0s/spirals is {\textasciitilde}40-80\% smaller and the average outer disk i-band luminosity is fainter by {\textasciitilde}42-70\% in Coma than in lower-density environments. These properties are likely indicative of environmental processes. (4) We compare our empirical results with predictions from a hierarchical semi-analytic model. No single cluster model can simultaneously match all the global properties (number density, mass function, halo properties) of the Coma cluster. Our study of Coma underscores that galaxy evolution is not solely a function of stellar mass, but also environment.},

We find that the analytic expectation of Gunn \& Gott, relating the gravitational restoring force provided by the disc to the ram pressure force, provides a good approximation to the radius at which gas will be stripped from a galaxy. However, at small radii it is also important to consider the potential provided by the bulge component. A spiral galaxy passing through the core of a rich cluster, such as Coma, will have its gaseous disc truncated to \~{}4 kpc, thus losing \~{}80 per cent of its diffuse gas mass. The time-scale for this to occur is a fraction of a crossing time \~{}107 yr. Galaxies orbiting within poorer clusters, or inclined to the direction of motion through the intracluster medium, will lose significantly less gas. We conclude that ram pressure alone is insufficient to account for the rapid and widespread truncation of star formation observed in cluster galaxies, or the morphological transformation of Sabs to S0s that is necessary to explain the {Butcher{\textendash}Oemler} effect.},

	abstract = {The {DEEP2} and {COMBO-17} surveys are used to study the evolution of the luminosity function of red and blue galaxies to \$z {\textbackslash}sim 1\$. Schechter function fits show that, since \$z = 1\$, {\$M{\textasciicircum}*\_B\$} dims by \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1.3 mag per unit redshift for both color classes, \${\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}*\$ of blue galaxies shows little change, while \${\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}*\$ for red galaxies has formally nearly quadrupled. At face value, the number density of blue galaxies has remained roughly constant since \$ z = 1\$, whereas that of red galaxies has been rising. Luminosity densities support both conclusions, but we note that most red-galaxy evolution occurs between our data and local surveys and in our highest redshift bin, where the data are weakest. We discuss the implications of having most red galaxies emerge after \$z = 1\$ from precursors among the blue population, taking into account the properties of local and distant {E/S0s.} We suggest a ``mixed'' scenario in which some blue galaxies have their star-formation quenched in gas-rich mergers, migrate to the red sequence with a variety of masses, and merge further on the red sequence in one or more purely stellar mergers. {E/S0s} of a given mass today will have formed via different routes, in a manner that may help to explain the fundamental plane and other local scaling laws.},

Evidence for mass loss in these systems is reviewed, mass loss by dying stars in them is analyzed, and it is shown that the gas must either be hidden in some undetectable form or be completely removed from the interstellar medium. Several ways to conceal the gas are considered and found to fail on one or more grounds, indicating that a removal mechanism is likely. Possible candidates investigated for such a mechanism are efficient star formation, sweeping by nuclear explosions, and hot supernova-driven galactic winds. It is shown that the presence of galactic winds in ellipticals not only can explain the observed lack of hydrogen, but also is apparently in agreement with other observations, including the lack of reddening in early-type galaxies and the preferential association of {RF} activity with massive ellipticals. The possibility that hot winds may provide internal removal mechanisms in the bulges of disk galaxies is briefly discussed.},

Three different models were used: (1) a single S{\'e}rsic function for the whole galaxy, (2) a bulge{\textendash}disc decomposition model using a de Vaucouleurs (R1/4) bulge plus exponential disc, (3) a bulge{\textendash}disc decomposition model using a S{\'e}rsic (R1/n) bulge plus exponential disc. Repeat observations for \~{}700 galaxies demonstrate that stable measurements can be obtained for object components with a half-light radius comparable to, or larger than, the seeing half width at half-maximum. We show that with careful quality control, robust measurements can be obtained for large samples such as the {MGC.} We use the catalogues to show that the galaxy colour bimodality is due to the two-component nature of galaxies (i.e. bulges and discs) and not due to two distinct galaxy populations. We conclude that understanding galaxy evolution demands the routine bulge{\textendash}disc decomposition of the giant galaxy population at all redshifts.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992MNRAS.254..601B},
	abstract = {We have undertaken a detailed comparison of the colours of early-type 
galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters. In Paper I (this issue), we
presented our system of homogeneous U, V, J and K photometric
measurements for these galaxies. In this paper, we use this data set to
investigate the universality of the colour-magnitude correlation. Our
work reassesses the anomaly noted by Aaronson, Persson \& Frogel.
Following these authors, we initially compare the relative distances of
the two clusters derived from the L-$\sigma$ and U - V and V - K colour-
magnitude correlations. However, in contrast to their result, we find
that all three relations give compatible relative distance moduli:
{\{DELTA\}m\_U-V\_} = 4.01+/-0.20, {\{DELTA\}m\_V-K\_} = 3.58+/-0.23, {\{DELTA\}m\_L-}
$\sigma$\_= 3.62+/-0.16. A similar result is found by correlating the
colours and velocity dispersions with photometric diameters. Again, we
find that all three comparisons give consistent distance estimates:
{\{DELTA\}m\_U-V\_=} 3.87+/-0.15, {\{DELTA\}m\_V-K\_} = 3.42+/-0.21, {\{DELTA\}m\_D-}
$\sigma$ = 3.67+/- 0.11, with a mean relative distance modulus of
3.69+/-0.08. These results show that the colour-magnitude relation has
the same form in both Coma and Virgo. An alternative approach is to
compare, the colours of the galaxies directly through the distance-
independent correlation between colour and velocity dispersion. We find
that the median colours are offset by -0.009+/-0.012 (U - V), 0.005+/-
0.016(V - K) and -0.038+/-0.012 (J - K), with an estimated systematic
error of 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04 mag in each case. All of these offsets are
therefore consistent with there being no intrinsic difference between
the colours of early-type galaxies in Virgo and Coma. We conclude that
the colour-magnitude relation has the same form in both clusters, and
hence can provide a reliable cosmic distance estimator for clusters of
galaxies, giving relative distances accurate to {\textasciitilde}20 per cent per galaxy.
In addition, our data constrain the intrinsic scatter of early-type
galaxies about the mean colour-magnitude relation. We measure an rms
scatter of typically 0.05 mag, of which {\textasciitilde}0.03 mag can be accounted for
by observational error. By examining the correlation of residuals, we
show that this intrinsic variation is unlikely to be dominated by
differences in the star formation histories of elliptical galaxies. We
use the stellar population synthesis model of Bruzual to quantify the
implications of this result. First, we present simple time-scale
arguments to suggest that the spheroidal components of early-type
galaxies are unlikely to have formed below a redshift of 2(40 = 0.5).
Secondly, we show that our data are only marginally consistent with the
strong bursts of star formation required to explain the spectra of
galaxies in moderate-redshift clusters.},

	abstract = {In the three-dimensional parameter space defined by velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), effective radius (Re ), and effective surface brightness (Ie ), early-type galaxies are observed to populate a two-dimensional fundamental plane ({FP)} with finite thickness. In Paper {III} of this series, we showed that the thickness of the {FP} is predominantly due to variations in the stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma$) inside the effective radius Re . These variations represent differences in the dark matter fraction inside Re (or possibly differences in the initial mass function) from galaxy to galaxy. This means that galaxies do not wind up below the {FP} at lower surface brightness due to the passive fading of their stellar populations; they are structurally different. Here, we show that these variations in $\Sigma$ at fixed dynamical mass (M dyn) are linked to differences in the galaxy stellar populations, and therefore to differences in their star formation histories. We demonstrate that the ensemble of stellar population and $\Sigma$ variations through the {FP} thickness can be explained by a model in which early-type galaxies at fixed M dyn have their star formation truncated at different times. The thickness of the {FP} can therefore be interpreted as a sequence of truncation times. Galaxies below the {FP} have earlier truncation times for a given M dyn, resulting in lower $\Sigma$, older ages, lower metallicities in both [{Fe/H]} and [{Mg/H]}, and higher [{Mg/Fe].} We show that this model is quantitatively consistent with simple expectations for chemical enrichment in galaxies. We also present fitting functions for luminosity-weighted age, [{Fe/H]}, [{Mg/H]}, and [{Mg/Fe]} as functions of the {FP} parameters $\sigma$, Re , and Ie . These provide a new tool for estimating the stellar population properties of quiescent early-type galaxies for which high-quality spectra are not available.},

We adopt density and radius estimation methods that match those used at lower redshift in order to study the evolution of the {MDR} and {MRR.} We detect a change in the {MDR} between 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2 and that observed at z {\textasciitilde} 0, consistent with recent work; specifically, the growth in the bulge-dominated galaxy fraction, {fE+S0}, with increasing density proceeds less rapidly at z {\textasciitilde} 1 than it does at z {\textasciitilde} 0. At z {\textasciitilde} 1 and $\Sigma$ >= 500 galaxies Mpc-2, we find {fE+S0} = 0.72 {\textpm} 0.10. At z {\textasciitilde} 0, an {E+S0} population fraction of this magnitude occurs at densities about 5 times smaller. The evolution in the {MDR} is confined to densities $\Sigma$ 40 galaxies Mpc-2 and appears to be primarily due to a deficit of S0 galaxies and an excess of {Sp+Irr} galaxies relative to the local galaxy population. The {fE-density} relation exhibits no significant evolution between z = 1 and 0. We find mild evidence to suggest that the {MDR} is dependent on the bolometric X-ray luminosity of the intracluster medium. Implications for the evolution of the disk galaxy population in dense regions are discussed in the context of these observations.},
